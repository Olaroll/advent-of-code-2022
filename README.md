## Journal
###### All times are relative to when I started, not when the task was opened.
### Day 01
#### Part 1: 00:40:46 --> Part 2: 00:09:12
- Spent quite a while figuring out how to iterate over each elf separately as a chunk.
- Later realized I could have split it into chunks with `\n\n` before parsing the input as lines.

### Day 02
#### Part 1: 00:24:57 --> Part 2: 00:07:12
- Went with simple match statements for the RPS logic.
- Quite happy with how the input iterating and parsing turned out.
- Had a bit of a brain fart at one point and lost like 10 mins >_<

### Day 03
#### Part 1: 00:24:07 --> Part 2: 00:21:09
- Spent most of the time figuring out HashSet intersections.
- This task took some fiddling to satisfy the borrow checker.

### Day 04
#### Part 1: 00:36:33 --> Part 2: 00:05:49
- Was fun to fiddle with iterators to find a clean solution.
- I'm on the fence about whether I should go full tryhard without caring about the quality of my solution.

### Day 05
#### Part 1: 01:11:42 --> Part 2: 00:23:33
- Today's inputs were super annoying to parse :c

### Day 06
#### Part 1: 00:10:09 --> Part 2: 00:00:28
- Simple as can be with the windows iterator :)

### Day 07
#### Part 1: 02:26:01 --> Part 2: 00:04:21
- I couldn't come up with any clever tricks, so I went ahead and parsed the whole file system into a proper tree.
- It was my first time making a tree in rust. It was hard, as expected :p
