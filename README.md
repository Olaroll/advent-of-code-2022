## Journal

### Day 01
#### Part 1: 00:40:46 --> Part 2: 00:09:12
- Spent quite a while figuring out how to iterate over each elf separately as a chunk.
- Later realized I could have split it into chunks with `\n\n` before parsing the input as lines.

### Day 02
#### Part 1: 00:24:57 --> Part 2: 00:07:12
- Went with simple match statements for the RPS logic.
- Quite happy with how the input iterating and parsing turned out.
- Had a bit of a brain fart at one point and lost like 10 mins >_<
